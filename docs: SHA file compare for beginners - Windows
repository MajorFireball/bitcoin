Since most people dont know how to verify SHA hashes for the core downloadI propose to add Powershell example to the site docs/faq.
On a Windows Computer, run Powershell (usually in the accessories menu or just do a search for Powershell)
In the blue window that opens, change to the folder where your file is located. 
Run the following command and compare the output to the site SHA256 hashes of the file you downloaded.
get-filehash <path to file> and hit enter.
Your output should resemble this and you can verify the hash on the bitcoincore.org website
